## Ribbit Frog V3
This is the hardware respository that contains all the design files for the physical assembly of the Frog Sensor.

## Bill of Materials (Parts List)

The hardware [Bill of Materials is located here.](ribbit_network_frog_sensor_bom.csv)


We also have an on-going effort to create different versions of the Bill of Materials that  are localized to different regions. See the [Folder here](https://github.com/Ribbit-Network/ribbit-network-frog-sensor/tree/main/hardware/v1/international_boms) for our current list. We welcome any new contributions!


# Mechanical CAD Files
The mechanical design files are hosted on Onshape. Onshape is available to use for free with public assemblies and you can create a copy of the assembly for any edits you would like to amek.
