# Assembly
Now to assemble everything!.

## Mount Beaglebone in Main Box
The first step is to the mount the Beagle Bone Green Gateway in the main
enclosure box.

Pleace the Beaglebone on the mounts as shown below.

Then attach the beagle bone using 3 M2.5 screws. Careful not to overtighten into
the 3D printed box.

## Wifi Antennae
Now the Wifi Antennae need to be connected to the Beaglebone and adhered to the
inside of the enclosure box.

Remove the adhesive backing and simply stick the antennae onto the inside of
the enclosure.

Next, connect the antennae connector to the beaglebone.

## Sensor Cable
Connect the Groove to QWIIC cable from the right I2C port on the Beaglebone
as shown below and route out of the hole in the top of the enclosure.

## CO2 Sensor Mounts
Next, the mounts for the CO2 sensor need to be installed. Screw four of the 
standoffs into the holes in the top of the enclosure box as shown below:

## CO2 Sensor
Mount the CO2 Sensor onto the standoffs as shown below.

## GPS
Mount the GPS onto the standoffs using two screws as show below.

## Barometer
Mount the Barometer onto the standoffs using two screws as show below.

## Sensor Cables
To install, the sensor cables, use one of the short cables to connect the GPS
to the Barometer as shown below:

Now, use the second cable and connect the barometer to the CO2 sensor. Make
sure the second port of the CO2 sensor is connected to the cable coming from the 
Beaglebone in the box.

## Sensor Shroud
Now that the electronics are all done, the protective shroud for the sensors
can be installed. Make sure the moutning notch is towards the back of the box.
Watch the wires and snap the shroud into place.

## Head On
The head of the Frog can now easily be snapped onto the top.

## Lid
The last step is to place the lid on the enclosure.

Snap the lid into the grove and then use a hex wrench to install the two bolts
at the bottom. Be sure not to overtighten into the platic.
