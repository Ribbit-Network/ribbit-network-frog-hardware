## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account
2. Clone the project to your machine
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
4. Commit changes to the branch
5. Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo
6. Push changes to your fork
7. Open a PR in our repository and follow the PR template so that we can efficiently review the changes.

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/Ribbit-Network/ribbit-network-frog-sensor/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/Ribbit-Network/ribbit-network-frog-sensor/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, pictures or sample code if relevant

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code or pictures of details if you can.
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

We *love* thorough bug reports. Not kidding, it's reports like this that make this project better!
